### Notes
- This is a forked build of [this](https://github.com/shuhei/babel-angular2-app) ng2 beta seed.
- Supports class/parameter decorators and parameter type annotations with [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel), [babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy](https://github.com/loganfsmyth/babel-plugin-transform-decorators-legacy) and [babel-plugin-angular2-annotations](https://github.com/shuhei/babel-plugin-angular2-annotations).
  - **Parameter decorator is not supported because the syntax is not supported by Babel's parser.**
- Watch bundles JavaScript files into one file with Browserify, Watchify and livereload.
